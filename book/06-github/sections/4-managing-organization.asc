=== Managing an organization

(((GitHub, organizations)))
In addition to single-user accounts, GitHub has what are called Organization accounts.
Like personal accounts, Organization accounts are a place where all an organization's projects are stored.
However many other things are different in Organization accounts, which are used by a group of people with shared
project ownership. Normally these accounts are used for open source projects (such as `perl` or `rails`)
or companies (such as `google` or `twitter`).

==== Organization Basics

An organization is easy to create; just click the "`+`" icon at the top-right of any GitHub page, and select `New organization` from the menu.

First, name your organization and provide an email address for a main point of contact.
Then invite other users to be members of the organization.

Follow these steps and you're soon the owner of a brand-new organization.
Like personal accounts, organizations are free if everything you plan to do there is public.

As a member of an organization, when you fork a repository, you have the choice of forking it to your organization's storage area.
When you create new repositories you can create them either under your personal account or under any of the organization accounts that you're a member of
You also automatically watch any new repositories created by these organizations.

Just like in <<_personal_avatar>>, you can upload an avatar for your organization to personalize it.
Also, like personal accounts, you have a publically viewable landing page for the organization that lists all of its repositories.

Now let's cover some of the things that are a bit different with an organizational account.

==== Teams

Organizations are associated with individual people by way of teams, which are simply a grouping of individual user accounts and repositories within the organization and what kind of access those people have in those repositories.

For example, say your company has three repositories: `frontend`, `backend`, and `deployscripts`.
You'd want your HTML/CSS/JavaScript developers to have access to `frontend` and maybe `backend`,
and your Operations people to have access to `backend` and `deployscripts`.
Teams make this easy, without having to manage access for each individual team member for every repository.

The Organization page shows a simple dashboard of all its repositories, users, and teams.

To manage your teams, click the Teams sidebar on the right hand side of the page in <<_org_page>>.
This brings you to a page for adding members to the team, adding repositories to the team, or managing the settings and access control levels for the team.
Each team can have read only, read/write, or administrative access to the repositories.
You can change the access level by clicking the `Settings` button in <<_team_page>>.

When you invite someone to join a team, they get an email letting them know they've been invited.

Additionally, team `@mentions` (such as `@acmecorp/frontend`) work much the same as they do with individual users, except that *all* members of the team are then subscribed to the thread.
This is useful if you want the attention of someone on a team, but you don't know exactly who.

A user can belong to any number of teams, so don't limit yourself to only access-control teams.
Special-interest teams like `ux`, `css`, or `refactoring` are useful for certain kinds of questions, and others like `legal` and `colorblind` for others.

==== Audit Log

Organizations also give members access to all the information about what has gone on in the organization.
Go to the 'Audit Log' tab and see what events have happened at an organization level, who did them, and where in the world they were done.

You can also filter down to specific types of events, specific places or specific people.
