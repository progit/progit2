=== Third Party Hosted Options

If you don't want to bother setting up your own Git server, there are several options for hosting Git
projects on a dedicated hosting site. These offer a number of advantages: you can start using a hosting site quickly,
and no hardware maintenance is required. Even if you set up and run your own server internally, you may still
want to use a public hosting site for your open source code. It's generally easier for the open source community
to access and contribute to.

These days, there are a huge number of hosting options to choose from, each with different advantages and disadvantages.
To see an up-to-date list, check out the GitHosting page on the main Git wiki at

We cover using GitHub in detail in <<ch06-github#ch06-github>>. It's the largest Git host out there and you may need
to interact with projects hosted on it, but there are dozens more to choose from should you not want to set up your own
Git server.
