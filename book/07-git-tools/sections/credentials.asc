=== Credential Storage

(((credentials)))
(((git commands, credential)))
If you use the SSH transport for connecting to remotes, it's possible to have a private key without a passphrase,
which allows you to securely transfer data without entering your username and password.
However, this isn't possible with the HTTP protocols -- every connection needs a username and password.
Systems with two-factor authentication are even more cumbersome, where the token you use for a
password is randomly generated and hard to remember.

Fortunately, Git has a credentials system that can help, with the following options:

* The default is to not cache at all.
  Every connection attempt results in a prompt for your username and password.
* `cache` mode keeps credentials in memory for a certain period of time.
  None of the passwords are ever stored on disk, and they're purged from the cache after 15 minutes.
* `store` mode saves the credentials in a plain-text file on disk, and they never expire.
  This means that until you change your password for the remote Git host, you don't have to enter your credentials again.
  The downside of this approach is that your passwords are stored in cleartext in an unencrypted file.
* If you're using a Mac, Git supports `osxkeychain` mode, which caches credentials in the secure keychain that's attached to your account.
  This method stores the credentials on disk, and they never expire, but they're encrypted using the same method used to encrypt HTTPS certificates and Safari auto-fills.
* If you're using Windows, install a helper called `Git Credential Manager for Windows.`
  This is similar to the `osxkeychain` helper described above, but uses the Windows Credential Store to control sensitive information.  It's at https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows[]. and is the successor to the `Windows Credential Store for Git` (`git-credential-winstore`, a.k.a. `wincred`), which is no longer being maintained.

Choose one of these modes by setting a Git configuration value.

[source,console]
----
$ git config --global credential.helper cache
----

Some of these helpers accept flags.
The `store` helper accepts the `--file <path>` flag, which determines where the plain-text
file is saved (the default is `~/.git-credentials`). The `cache` helper accepts
the `--timeout <seconds>` flag, which changes the amount of time its daemon is kept running
(the default is `900` seconds, or 15 minutes).
Here's how to configure the `store` helper with a custom filename.


[source,console]
----
$ git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ~/.my-credentials'
----

Git even allows you to configure several helpers.
When looking for credentials for a particular host, Git queries them in order, and stops
after it gets the first answer.
When saving credentials, Git sends the username and password to *all* of the helpers in the list,
and the helpers choose what to do with them.
Here's what a `.gitconfig` would look like if you had a credentials file on a thumb drive,
but wanted to use the in-memory cache to save typing if the drive isn't plugged in.

[source,ini]
----
[credential]
    helper = store --file /mnt/thumbdrive/.git-credentials
    helper = cache --timeout 30000
----

==== Under the Hood

How does this all work?
The command for the credential-helper system is `git credential`, which takes a command as an argument,
and then more input through stdin.

This might be easier to understand with an example.
Let's say that a credential helper has been configured, and the helper has stored credentials for `mygithost`.
Here's a session that uses the `fill` subcommand, which is run when Git tries to find credentials for a host.

[source,console]
----
$ git credential fill <1>
protocol=https <2>
host=mygithost
<3>
protocol=https <4>
host=mygithost
username=bob
password=s3cre7
$ git credential fill <5>
protocol=https
host=unknownhost

Username for 'https://unknownhost': bob
Password for 'https://bob@unknownhost':
protocol=https
host=unknownhost
username=bob
password=s3cre7
----

<1> This is the command line that initiates the interaction.
<2> Git-credential is then waiting for input on stdin.
    We provide it with the things we know: the protocol and hostname.
<3> A blank line indicates that the input is complete, and the credential system should answer with what it knows.
<4> `gitcredential` then takes over, and writes the information it found to stdout.
<5> If credentials aren't found, Git asks the user for the username and password, and sends them to stdout.

The credential system actually runs a separate program from Git itself. Which one and how it's
run depend on the `credential.helper` configuration value. There are several possibilities.

[options="header"]
|======
| Configuration Value | Behavior
| `foo` | Runs `git-credential-foo`
| `foo -a --opt=bcd` | Runs `git-credential-foo -a --opt=bcd`
| `/absolute/path/foo -xyz` | Runs `/absolute/path/foo -xyz`
| `!f() { echo "password=s3cre7"; }; f` | Code after `!` evaluated in shell
|======

The helpers described above are actually named `git-credential-cache`, `git-credential-store`, and so on. We can configure them to take command-line arguments.
The general form for this is "`git-credential-foo [args] <action>.`"
The stdin/stdout usage is the same as `git-credential`, but with a slightly different set of actions.

* `get` is a request for a username/password pair.
* `store` is a request to save a set of credentials in this helper's memory.
* `erase` purges the credentials for the given properties from this helper's memory.

For the `store` and `erase` actions, no response is required (Git ignores it anyway).
For the `get` action, however, Git is very interested in what the helper has to say.
If the helper doesn't know anything useful, it can simply exit with no output, but if it does know something, it should augment the provided information with the information it has stored.
The output is treated like a series of assignment statements. Anything provided replaces what Git already knows.

Here's the same example from above, but skipping `git credential` and going straight for `git-credential-store`:

[source,console]
----
$ git credential-store --file ~/git.store store <1>
protocol=https
host=mygithost
username=bob
password=s3cre7
$ git credential-store --file ~/git.store get <2>
protocol=https
host=mygithost

username=bob <3>
password=s3cre7
----

<1> Save some credentials: the username `bob` and the password `s3cre7` are to be used when `https://mygithost` is accessed.
<2> Retrieve those credentials.
    Provide the parts of the connection we already know (`https://mygithost`), and an empty line.
<3> Reply with the username and password stored above.

Here's how the `~/git.store` file looks.

[source,ini]
----
https://bob:s3cre7@mygithost
----

It's just a series of lines, each of which contains a credential-decorated URL.
The `osxkeychain` and `wincred` helpers use the native format of their backing stores, while `cache` uses its own in-memory format (which no other process can read).

==== A Custom Credential Cache

Given that `git-credential-store` and friends are separate programs from Git,
it's not much of a leap to realize that _any_ program can be a Git credential helper.
The helpers provided by Git cover many, but not all, common use cases.
For example, let's say your team has some credentials that are shared with the entire team,
perhaps for deployment. These are stored in a shared directory, but you don't want to copy them
to your own credential store, because they change often.
None of the existing helpers cover this case. Let's see what it would take to write our own.
There are several key features this program needs to have.

. The only action we need to pay attention to is `get`. `store` and `erase` are write operations, so we just exit cleanly when they're received.
. The file format of the shared-credential file is the same as that used by `git-credential-store`.
. The location of that file is fairly standard, but we should allow the user to pass a custom path just in case.

Once again, we write this extension in Ruby, but any language works as long as Git can
execute the finished product. Here's the full source code of our new credential helper.

[source,ruby]
----
include::../git-credential-read-only[]
----

<1> Parse the command-line flags, allowing the user to specify the input file. The default is `~/.git-credentials`.
<2> This program only responds if the action is `get` and the backing-store file exists.
<3> This loop reads from stdin until the first blank line is reached.
    The inputs are stored in the `known` hash for later reference.
<4> This loop reads the content of the storage file, looking for matches.
    If the protocol and host from `known` match this line, the program prints the results to stdout and exits.

We save our helper as `git-credential-read-only`, put it somewhere in our `PATH`, and mark it executable.
Here's what an interactive session looks like.

[source,console]
----
$ git credential-read-only --file=/mnt/shared/creds get
protocol=https
host=mygithost
username=bob

protocol=https
host=mygithost
username=bob
password=s3cre7
----

Since its name starts with "`git-`", we can use the simple syntax for the configuration value.

[source,console]
zsh:1: command not found: s
$ git config --global credential.helper 'read-only --file /mnt/shared/creds'
----

As you see, extending this system is pretty straightforward, and can solve some common problems for you and your team.
