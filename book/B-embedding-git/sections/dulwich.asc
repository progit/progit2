=== Dulwich

(((Dulwich)))(((Python)))
There's also a pure-Python Git implementation called Dulwich.
The project is hosted at https://www.dulwich.io/ .
It aims to provide an interface to Git repositories, both local and remote, that doesn't run Git directly
but instead uses pure Python. It has an optional C extension which significantly improves performance.

Dulwich follows Git design by separating two basic levels of API -- plumbing and porcelain.

Here's an example of using the lower level API to access the commit message of the last commit.

[source, python]
----
from dulwich.repo import Repo
r = Repo('.')
r.head()
# '57fbe010446356833a6ad1600059d80b1e731e15'

c = r[r.head()]
c
# <Commit 015fc1267258458901a94d228e39f0a378370466>

c.message
# 'Add note about encoding.\n'
----

To print a commit log using the high-level porcelain API, run

[source, python]
----
from dulwich import porcelain
porcelain.log('.', max_entries=1)
