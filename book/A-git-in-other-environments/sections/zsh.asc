=== Git in Zsh

(((zsh)))(((tab completion, zsh)))(((shell prompts, zsh)))
Zsh also includes a tab-completion library for Git.
To use it, simply run `autoload -Uz compinit && compinit` in your `.zshrc`.
Zsh's interface is a bit more powerful than Bash's.

[source,console]
----
$ git che<tab>
check-attr        -- display gitattributes information
check-ref-format  -- ensure that a reference name is well formed
checkout          -- checkout branch or paths to working tree
checkout-index    -- copy files from index to working directory
cherry            -- find commits not merged upstream
cherry-pick       -- apply changes introduced by some existing commits
----

Ambiguous tab-completions aren't just listed -- they have helpful descriptions, and you can graphically
navigate the list by repeatedly hitting tab. This works with Git commands, their arguments,
and names of things inside the repository (like refs and remotes), as well as filenames and
all the other things zsh knows how to tab-complete.

Zsh ships with a framework for getting information from version control systems called `vcs_info`.
To include the branch name on the right hand side of the prompt, add these lines to your `~/.zshrc` file.

[source,console]
----
autoload -Uz vcs_info
precmd_vcs_info() { vcs_info }
precmd_functions+=( precmd_vcs_info )
setopt prompt_subst
RPROMPT='${vcs_info_msg_0_}'
# PROMPT='${vcs_info_msg_0_}%# '
zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' formats '%b'
----

This results in a display of the current branch on the right-hand side of the terminal window, whenever your shell is inside a Git repository.
The left side is supported as well, of course. Just uncomment the assignment to `PROMPT`.
It looks like

For more information on `vcs_info`, check out its documentation in the `zshcontrib(1)` manual page, or online at https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/User-Contributions.html#Version-Control-Information[^].

Instead of `vcs_info`, you might prefer the prompt customization script that ships with Git, called `git-prompt.sh`; see https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh[^] for details.
`git-prompt.sh` is compatible with both Bash and Zsh.

Zsh is powerful enough that there are entire frameworks dedicated to making it better.
One of them is called "oh-my-zsh", and it can be found at https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh[^].
`oh-my-zsh`'s plugin system comes with powerful Git tab-completion, and it has a variety of prompt "themes", many of which display version-control data.
<<oh_my_zsh_git>> is just one example of what can be done with this system.
