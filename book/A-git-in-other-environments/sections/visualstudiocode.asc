=== Git in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code has Git support built in.
You need to have Git version 2.0.0 (or newer) installed.

The main features are

* See the diff of the file you are editing in the gutter.
* The Git Status Bar (lower left) shows the current branch, dirty indicators, incoming and outgoing commits.
* You can do the most common git operations from within the editor:
** Initialize a repository.
** Clone a repository.
** Create branches and tags.
** Stage and commit changes.
** Push/pull/sync with a remote branch.
** Resolve merge conflicts.
** View diffs.
* With an extension, you can also handle GitHub Pull Requests:
