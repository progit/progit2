The standard command-line terminal on Windows (`cmd.exe`) isn't really capable of a customized Git experience, but if you're using Powershell, you're in luck.
A package called Posh-Git (https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git[]) provides powerful tab-completion facilities, as well as an enhanced prompt to help you stay on top of your repository status. It looks like this:

If you've installed GitHub for Windows, Posh-Git is included by default, and all you have to do is add these lines to your `profile.ps1` (which is usually located in `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell`):

[source,powershell]
-----
. (Resolve-Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\GitHub\shell.ps1")
. $env:github_posh_git\profile.example.ps1
-----

If you're not a GitHub for Windows user, just download a Posh-Git release from (https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git[]), and uncompress it to the `WindowsPowershell` directory.
Then open a Powershell prompt as the administrator, and do this:

[source,powershell]
-----
> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Confirm
> cd ~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\posh-git
> .\install.ps1
-----

This will add the proper line to your `profile.ps1` file, and posh-git will be active the next time you open your prompt.
