=== Git in Sublime Text

From version 3.2 onwards, Sublime Text includes Git integration.

Some features are

* The sidebar will show the `git status` of files and folders with a badge/icon.
* Files and folders in `.gitignore` are faded out in the sidebar.
* The status bar shows the current Git branch and how many modifications you have made.
* All changes to a file are now visible via markers in the gutter.
* You can use part of the Sublime Merge Git client functionality from within Sublime Text.
  This requires that Sublime Merge is installed.
