=== Git in Visual Studio

(((Visual Studio)))
Visual Studio has Git tooling built directly into the IDE. On previous versions of Visual Studio, Git support can be found in Team Explorer. Starting from Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8, Visual Studio has an all new Git experience. We recommend using the latest version of Visual Studio to get the best Git experience.

The tooling supports the following Git functionality:

* Create or clone a repository.
* Open and browse history of a repository.
* Create and checkout branches and tags.
* Stash, stage, and commit changes.
* Fetch, pull, push, or sync commits.
* Merge and rebase branches.
* Resolve merge conflicts.
* View diffs.
* ... and more!
