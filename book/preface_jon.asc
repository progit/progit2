[preface]
== Preface by Jon Forrest
First of all, I want to make it clear that I didn't write this book. This is Scott Chacon and Ben Straub's book,
which they released under a Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 3.0 license.
All I did was edit it. I'm distinguishing the original book from this edited version by calling
this version Pro Git Second Edition Reedited. Naturally, I'm releasing it under that same Creative Commons license.

When I started learning Git, I spent a fair amount of time reading the first edition of Pro Git.
I found that it was a 2 step forward, 1 step back experience. By this I mean I'd learn a couple
of new things but then I'd either read something I didn't understand, or else I'd realize that my
previous understanding was wrong. But, once I developed a better understanding of Git, I went back
to re-read the sections that I didn't previously understand. I'd almost always think to myself that
if only this word or that phrase could be changed slightly, the concept would have been much easier
to understand. This happens to me a lot when reading technical books. 

Given that Scott and Ben were generous enough to release Pro Git Second Edition as a free book with
the manuscript sources available at GitHub, I decided to return the favor by doing a complete edit
in an attempt to improve the areas I had trouble with and to generally tighten up the text.

It's crystal clear that Scott and Ben know more about Git than I'll ever know.
Plus, I'm the first to admit that I'm no Git expert.
For these reasons, I didn't even attempt to find technical errors in the text or in the examples.
What I did instead was to go over each paragraph, one by one, asking myself if I really understood what it
was saying, and whether I could change it into something clearer. As a result, I made a lot of changes.
Most of these I'd have a hard time defending because they're very subjective.
In fact, it might turn out that I'm overly sensitive and that everybody else is already satisfied with
Pro Git Second Edition.
If you fall into this category then you probably won't find much value in this edition.
Also, in my efforts to achieve clarity I might have gone too far,
and accidentally changed something to be just plain wrong. I'm entirely responsible for any such errors.
Please point out any errors and ways to make things even clearer. I intend to keep this book updated
with the results of your input.

Unless I've made a serious mistake in judgment, I think that Pro Git Second Edition Reedited can replace
Pro Git Second Edition for English readers.
I'm not sure whether it's worth translating this edition into other languages.
In fact, I'd like to think of it as simply a collection of English-specific
edits that can be ignored in other languages.

I welcome your feedback. Please open an issue on https://github.com/nobozo/progit2-re
with any comments or errors.
