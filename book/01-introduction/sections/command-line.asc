=== The Command Line

There are several ways to use Git -- on the command line or using a graphical user interface (GUI).
In this book, we use Git on the command line.
One reason for this is that the command line is the only place where you can run _all_ Git commands -- most GUIs only implement a subset of Git.
If you know how to run Git on the command line, you can probably also figure out how to use it from a GUI, while the opposite isn't necessarily true.
Also, while your choice of GUI is a matter of personal taste, the command-line tools are available to _all_ users.

So we expect you to know how to open Terminal in macOS, Command Prompt or PowerShell in Windows,
or Xterm or equivalent in Linux.
If you don't know what we're talking about, you need to figure this out so that you can follow the rest of the examples in this book.
