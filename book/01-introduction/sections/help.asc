=== Getting Help

If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:

[source,console]
----
$ git help <verb>
$ git <verb> --help
$ man git-<verb>
----

For example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running(((git commands, help)))

[source,console]
----
$ git help config
----

These commands are nice because you can access them anywhere, even offline.
If the manpages and this book aren't enough and you need in-person help, you can try the `#git` or `#github` channel on the Freenode IRC server (irc.freenode.net).
These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.(((IRC)))
