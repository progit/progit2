=== Getting Help

If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to see the manual page for any Git command.

[source,console]
----
$ git help <verb>
$ git <verb> --help
$ man git-<verb>
----

For example, to see the manual page for `git config`, run(((git commands, help)))

[source,console]
----
$ git help config
----

These commands are nice because you can run them anytime, even when offline.

If the manual pages and this book aren't enough and you need personal help, try the `#git`, `#github`, or `#gitlab` channels on the Libera Chat IRC server at https://libera.chat/[^].
These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.(((IRC)))

In addition, if you don't need to see the complete manual page, but just need a quick summary of the available flags for a Git command, use the `-h` or `--help` flag to the command.
