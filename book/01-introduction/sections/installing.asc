=== Installing Git

Before you start using Git, you have to install it.
Even if it's already installed, it's probably a good idea to update to the latest version.
You can either install it as a package or download the source code and build it yourself.

[NOTE]
====
This book was written using Git version 2. Though most of the commands we use should work in older versions,
some might not or might work slightly differently.
Since Git is quite excellent at preserving backwards compatibility, any version after 2.0 should work just fine.

==== Installing on Linux

(((Linux, installing)))
To install Git on Linux, run the package-management tool that comes with your Linux distribution.

If you're on RedHat, CentOS, or Fedora, run `dnf`.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo dnf install git-all
----

If you're on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try  running `apt`.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install git-all
----

There are instructions for installing on other Linux and Unix flavors on the Git website https://git-scm.com/download/linux[].

==== Installing on macOS

(((macOS, installing)))
There are several ways to install Git on macOS.
The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools.(((Xcode)))
On Mavericks (10.9) and above simply run 'git' from the Terminal.

[source,console]
----
$ git --version
----

If you don't have Git installed already, you'll be prompted to install it.

To run a more up to date version, install it using an installer
available for download at the Git website https://git-scm.com/download/mac[].

You can also install Git as part of the GitHub for macOS package.
Their GUI Git tool has an option to install the Git command line tools as well.
Download that package from the GitHub for macOS website https://desktop.github.com[].

==== Installing on Windows

There are several ways to install Git on Windows.(((Windows, installing)))
The most popular is to install the version that's available for download on the Git website.
Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win[] and the download starts automatically.
Note that this is a project called Git for Windows, which is separate from Git itself.
For more information, go to https://gitforwindows.org[].

You can also use the https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/git[Git Chocolatey package^].
Note that the Git Chocolatey package is community maintained.

==== Building from Source

You might instead find it useful to build Git from source, because this gives you the most recent version.
The binary installers tend to be a bit behind, although as Git matures, this is less important.

To build Git from source, you need the following libraries that Git depends on: autotools, curl, zlib, openssl, expat, and libiconv.
For example, on a system that has yum (RedHat or CentOS), `dnf` (Fedora), or `apt-get` (Debian-based system), run the corresponding command below to install the
dependencies for compiling and installing Git.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo yum install dh-autoreconf curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel \
  openssl-devel perl-devel zlib-devel
$ sudo dnf install dh-autoreconf curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel \
  openssl-devel perl-devel zlib-devel
$ sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev \
  gettext libz-dev libssl-dev
----

To install the documentation in various formats (doc, html, info), run one of the following commands:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo yum install asciidoc xmlto docbook2X getopt
$ sudo dnf install asciidoc xmlto docbook2X getopt
$ sudo apt-get install asciidoc xmlto docbook2x getopt
----

Users of RHEL and RHEL-derivatives, like CentOS, must enable the EPEL repository to install the `docbook2X` package.
Check Google for instructions on how to do this.
Additionally, run this to resolve binary name differences.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/db2x_docbook2texi /usr/bin/docbook2x-texi
----

On a Debian-based distribution (Debian/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-derivatives), you also need the `install-info` package.

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt-get install install-info
----

On a RPM-based distribution (Fedora/RHEL/RHEL-derivatives), you also need the `getopt` package (which is already installed on a Debian-based distro).

[source,console]
----
$ sudo dnf install getopt
----

After you've installed all the necessary dependencies, grab the latest tagged Git release tarball
from kernel.org at https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git[], or the mirror on the GitHub website, at https://github.com/git/git/releases[].
Make sure you're downloading the latest version of Git, and check the release signatures to verify your download.

Then, compile and install.

[source,console]
----
$ tar -zxf git-2.8.0.tar.gz
$ cd git-2.8.0
$ make configure
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make all doc info
$ sudo make install install-doc install-html install-info
----

After this is done, you can also clone the Git repository itself:

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
----
