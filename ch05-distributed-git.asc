== Distributed Git

(((distributed git)))
Now that you've set up a remote Git repository for your developers to share code, and you're familiar with the
basic Git commands that work on local repositories, we now look at how to utilize some of the distributed workflows
that Git allows.

In this chapter, you see how to work with Git in a distributed environment as a contributor and as an integrator.
That is, you learn how to contribute code to a project while making it as easy on you and the project maintainer
as possible, and also how to maintain a project that a number of developers contribute to.

other users' contributions. Congratulations on being an effective Git developer!
