== Git and Other Systems

The world isn't perfect.
You can't always immediately convert every project you come in contact with to Git.
Sometimes you're stuck on a project using another VCS.
We spend the first part of this chapter learning about how to use Git as a client when the project
you're working on is hosted on a different VCS.

The second part of this chapter covers how to migrate an existing project from several VCSs
into Git, as well as a method that works if no pre-built import tool exists.

=== Git as a Client

(((Git as a client)))
Git provides such a nice experience that many people prefer to use it,
even if the rest of their team is using an entirely different VCS.
For this to happen, a "bridge" must exist between Git and the other VCS.
Fortunately, many bridges have been created.
Here we cover the ones you're most likely to run into.

=== Migrating to Git

(((Migrating to Git)))
If you have an existing project in another VCS but you've decided to switch to Git,
you must somehow migrate everything over.
This section goes over importers for common VCSs, and then demonstrates how to develop
your own custom importer. You learn how to import from several of the popular professional VCSs,
because they're used by the majority of users who are switching, and because high-quality
tools for making the switch are easy to come by.

=== Summary

You should feel comfortable using Git as a client for other VCSs, or importing nearly any
existing repository into Git. In the next chapter, we cover the raw internals of Git so
you can understand what's really going on internally.
