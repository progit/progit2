== Git in Other Environments

If you read through the whole book, you've learned a lot about how to use Git at the command line.
You can work with local files, connect your repository to others over a network, and work effectively with collaborators.
But the story doesn't end there. Git is usually used as part of a larger ecosystem, and the terminal
isn't always the best way to work with it. Now we'll take a look at some of the other kinds of environments
where Git can be useful, and how other applications work alongside Git.
