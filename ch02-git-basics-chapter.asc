== Git Basics

If you read only one chapter in this book, this is it.
It covers the basic Git commands that you use the vast majority of time.
By the end of the chapter, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, start and stop
tracking files, and stage and commit changes.
We also show how to tell Git to ignore certain files and filename patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly
and easily, how to browse the history of your project, how to view changes made by commits,
and how to push and pull from remote repositories.

=== Summary

At this point, you know how to perform all the basic local Git operations -- creating or cloning a repository,
making changes, staging and committing those changes, and viewing the history
of all the changes in the repository.

Next, we cover Git's killer feature: its branching model.
