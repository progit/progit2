= Pro Git, Second Edition

Welcome to the second edition of the Pro Git book.

You can find this book online at: http://git-scm.com/book

Like the first edition, the second edition of Pro Git is open source under a Creative Commons license.

A couple of things have changed since open sourcing the first edition.
For one, we've moved from Markdown to the amazing Asciidoc format for the text of the book.

We've also moved to keeping the translations in separate repositories rather than subdirectories of the English repository.
See link:CONTRIBUTING.md[the Contributing document] for more information.

== How To Generate the Book

There are two ways to generate e-book content from this source code.

The easiest way is simply to let us do it.

You can find the current HTML version on http://git-scm.com/book[].

The other way to generate e-book files is to do so manually with Asciidoctor.
If you run the following you _may_ actually get HTML, Epub, Mobi and PDF output files:

----
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
Converting to HTML...
 -- HTML output at progit.html
Converting to EPub...
 -- Epub output at progit.epub
Converting to Mobi (kf8)...
 -- Mobi output at progit.mobi
Converting to PDF...
 -- PDF  output at progit.pdf
----

This uses the `asciidoctor`, `asciidoctor-pdf` and `asciidoctor-epub` projects.

Another option is to run the following:

----
asciidoctor-pdf progit.asc
----
