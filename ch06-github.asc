(((GitHub)))
GitHub is one of the largest Git hosting sites, and is the central point of collaboration
for millions of developers and projects. A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub.
Many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code review, and other things.
So while it's not an actual part of the Git open source project, there's a good chance that you interact
with GitHub.

This chapter is about using GitHub effectively.
We cover signing up for and managing an account, creating and using Git repositories,
common workflows to contribute to projects, workflows for accepting contributions to your projects,
GitHub's programmatic interface, and lots of little tips to make your life easier.

If you're not interested in using GitHub to host your own projects or to collaborate with other projects, you can safely skip to <<ch07-git-tools#ch07-git-tools>>.
